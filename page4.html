                <blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<strong>EDUCATION</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; <a href="index.html" class="text-secondary"><strong><em>HOME</em></strong></a></p></blockquote><blockquote><span style="font-style: normal;">•	<strong>Rafael Centre</strong>, a school and training centre for Special Educators and Physio Therapists who work with differently abled children and adults. We have hired three physio therapists to travel among the various community centres of Samvedna and teach the caregivers of differently abled children how to improve the health, mobility and lives of their charges. Their progress and improvements are tracked and reported to make sure we are doing it properly and properly aiding them.
</span></blockquote><blockquote><span style="font-style: normal;">•	<strong>Rural Litigation and Entitlement Kendra (RLEK)</strong>. We have paid the salaries of teachers in 15 of their schools, 963 students, for 6 years, and we are encouraged to use their schools as base points for mountain village outreach programs. We recently funded the building of two Senior Primary Schools in Jangheri and Miyani, which are fully certified and operational now. We also use these schools for health camps conducted periodically by HIMAID.
</span></blockquote><blockquote><span style="font-style: normal;">•<strong>	Toon Masti, Ernst &amp; Young Foundation</strong>, a CBSE certified, cartoon-based course from Nursery through Class 5 in Math and Social Science. Ernst and Young Foundation donated the program to us 7 years ago and we were the first in North India to use it in the schools we sponsor. Now 3.8 million students are using it, but we were the first.
</span></blockquote><blockquote><span style="font-style: normal;">•	<strong>Sampan</strong>, a group of four English Medium schools scattered across Uttarakhand. We support salaries for their teachers so they can expand their efforts. They offer secular, high standard schooling to remote villages at no, or very low cost and seek to improve the quality of life of their students. The organization is 8 years old now and its founder and primary advisor is Dr. Nathan Grills, of the University of Melbourne, Australia who has conducted seminal work in the field and is co-author of a manual </span><strong>“Setting up Community Health and Development Programmes in Low and Middle Income Settings”</strong><span style="font-style: normal;"> which is widely used in Asia.
</span></blockquote><blockquote><span style="font-style: normal;">•	<strong>Azim Premji Foundation</strong>. NSF is the only non-governmental organization that they have ever worked with. We set up libraries in 15 schools using books donated by the organization. They also ran semi-annual advanced teacher training courses for us for 47 village teachers and helped them to obtain their required B.Ed. degrees in order to meet state requirements.
</span></blockquote><blockquote><span style="font-style: normal;">•	<strong>George Huhn</strong>, founder of <strong>DATAMACHINES</strong> and a scientist, recently donated his software to be used to evaluate projects using a patented method he invented. He previously worked with DuPont-Merck on anti-aging compounds and was a consultant world-wide for large corporations but is now retired.
</span></blockquote><blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>&nbsp; HEALTH<span style="font-style: normal;">
</span></strong></p></blockquote><blockquote><span style="font-style: normal;">•<strong>	Samvedna</strong>, an effort of the Emmanuel Hospital Association, with whom we have worked for 6 years in providing funding for physiotherapists. This is the organization that works with the three physios that we hired, and they use Samvedna’s outreach centres to reach their families. The program has been very effective in changing perceptions and providing tools for the caregivers to use in their daily interactions with their charges.
</span></blockquote><blockquote><span style="font-style: normal;">•	<strong>Matli Clinic and Health Centre</strong>, is operated by Dr. Dwayne Niebur, a family physician and his wife, JoAnn, a Registered Nurse and Midwife with specialized training from AIIMS for cervical cancer treatment in women. We are trying to set up a program where village women can make their own re-usable sanitary napkins as well as sell them for income.
</span></blockquote><blockquote><span style="font-style: normal;">•<strong>	HIMAID</strong>, NSF helped found this organization, which is composed of a group of retired Indian Army doctors, some operating their own practices, that conducts health camps in remote areas of Uttarakhand. They come from various specialties and Nora Solomon Foundation financially supports the cost of the medicines that they dispense during their health camps in the mountains.
</span></blockquote><blockquote><span style="font-style: normal;">•	<strong>CHGN-UKC, Community Health Global Network, Uttarakhand cluster</strong>. We provided funding for a drive to give 193 wheelchairs, walkers, crutches, canes and hand grippers to 288 people, 97 of them children. They came from four states for this and transport was provided. We continue to cooperate with and sponsor activities of this organization since they have a broad reach and our aims are the same.
</span></blockquote><blockquote><span style="font-style: normal;">•<strong>	KinderHilfWerke (KHW)</strong>, a German sponsored organization that offers schooling for orphans and poor local villagers and operates outreach programs in conjunction with Lehman Hospital and members of the CHGN-UKC. They have been instrumental in finding and staging Special Education Teachers for the mountain villages operating under Emmanuel Hospital Association and the associated Samvedna organization of Landour Community Hospital, with whom we are working.
</span></blockquote><blockquote><span style="font-style: normal;">•	<strong>Dr. Purvesh Khatri, KhatriLab at Stanford University</strong>, is a world-renowned TB expert who operates his own large lab at Stanford. We are currently working with him to try to implement his patented TB test system in India, which uses a blood sample, not sputum, to verify the existence of antibodies to TB in a patient’s bloodstream and can do so in 30 minutes. It currently meets WHO standards for accuracy and low false positive rates. This is a long-term project, in only the initial phase so far, but we may use our village populations for testing, education and prevention, since Uttarakhand has the highest rate of TB per population in India. Something few people are aware of.
</span></blockquote><blockquote><span style="font-style: normal;">•	<strong>Hamara Centre</strong>, works with extremely poor, differently abled children of local farmers outside Roorkie. They provide a pick and drop service to their centre and NSF supports them with needed physio and educational materials to continue their work.
